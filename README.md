# HTML-GIT-CSS **Horiseon**
Work concluded in this challenge with the refactoring of **div** tags with **semantic** tags making it more accessible for future implementation and revisions.
Notes were added to further improve the detail of semantic tag possibilities. Providing a discription to the images on the web page. Finally some notes detailing on additions added to correct isues with the web browser. (Ex. on line 30 id="search-engine-optimization" was added to optimize the broswers direction). 
The **CSS** was consolidated and formed into a more streamlined fashion for readability.
